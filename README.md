- Hello visitor, I‚Äôm than3
  
I'm an IT System Administrator with over a decade of experience setting up infrastructure mostly within a Microsoft ecosystem, but also under Linux with a strong networking background.

Electronics/Firmware, MIS, Infrastructure and Cybersecurity, are my main primary interests, I am an expert generalist.

I'm currently exploring opportunities outside my area of expertise given the lack of gainful employment available in recent years (starting in 2022). 
At this point it has become clear that the downturn is no longer just a fad, but rather a strong trend suggesting that there is no future in IT based roles.

Experiences in job seeking, and with recruiters, showing poor call conversion ratios support this view. I've seen a multiple order of magnitude reduction in the response rate for any IT position, and equal order of magnitude increases in illegitimate ghost job postings.
There is no longer any clear differentiable way to tell legitimate postings from fake. One must go wherever the work is to put food on the table.

A 1200:1 application to cold call response ratio for someone of my professional experience is absolutely untenable.

- üíûÔ∏è I'm not currently looking to collaborate on any FOSS projects at this time, or in the future. I've migrated my primary repositories off github.
