- Hello visitor, I’m than3
  
I'm a IT System Administrator with a decade of related experience setting up infrastructure mostly within a Microsoft Ecosystem, but I also have a strong background in Linux.
Electronics (Firmware), Infrastructure and Cybersecurity are my main interests.

I’m currently learning more about implementations of Software Defined Networking (SDN) 

- 💞️ I'm not currently looking to collaborate on any FOSS projects at this time. I may not be hosting on github much longer given recent events over the past two years.
